In this assignment, an interactive dashboard is created to explore the navel biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize the human navel.
The data set reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units or OTUs in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

You will find:
-  index.html
-  samples.json
-  js folder 
inside the js folder you will find the files app.js and bonus.js
This assignment uses Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create data visualizations that are engaging, accessible, and interactive.
